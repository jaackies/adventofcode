import sys

# pushups done: 

# each line in map: three numbers
# destination range start, source range start, range length
# if is not described, the source & destination are the same number
# goal: find the lowerst location number

#step one: compile into data structs to store.
# step two: fuck around
# step three: FIND. OUT.

### uhhh action plan
# probably a "convert" function that takes storage tuple and source and returns destination

#list of tuples (sevral)

def populate():
    for line in sys.stdin:
        return -1

#match() tells you which one to use

populate()

for seed in seeds:
    match()
    convert()

print("ANSWER HERE")
print("expected: 35")
